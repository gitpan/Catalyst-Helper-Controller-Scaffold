NAME
    Catalyst::Helper::Controller::Scaffold - Helper for Scaffolding

SYNOPSIS
        # Imagine you want to generate a scaffolding controller MyApp::C::SomeTable
        # for a CDBI table class MyApp::M::CDBI::SomeTable
        script/myapp_create.pl controller SomeTable Scaffold CDBI::SomeTable

DESCRIPTION
    Helper for Scaffolding.

    Templates are TT so you'll need a TT View Component and a forward in
    your end action too.

    Note that you have to add these lines to your CDBI class...

        use Class::DBI::AsForm;
        use Class::DBI::FromForm;

    ...and these to your application class, to load the FormValidator
    plugin.

        use Catalyst qw/FormValidator/;

METHODS
    mk_compclass
